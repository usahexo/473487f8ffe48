#  The biggest betting firms in the world are all vying for a piece of the Ajax pie!

Ajax, the Dutch football club that has produced some of the biggest names in the sport, is up for sale and the world’s biggest betting firms are all vying for a piece of the action.

Led by British gambling giant, William Hill, the list of would-be buyers includes some of the biggest names in the business, including Ladbrokes, Coral, and Paddy Power.

The bidding process is expected to start at around €200 million (£172 million) and Ajax’s current owners, who took over in 2006, are reportedly keen to cash in on their investment.

Ajax has a long and illustrious history, having been founded all the way back in 1900. The club has won 34 league titles and four European Cups and is considered one of the most successful clubs in world football.

The likes of Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Clarence Seedorf all started their careers at Ajax and went on to become global superstars.

Current stars such as Davy Klaassen, Hakim Ziyech and Justin Kluivert – son of Dutch legend Patrick Kluivert – could be heading for pastures new if a deal goes through.

Whoever buys Ajax will need to invest heavily in order to keep up with Europe’s top clubs. The likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid have been spending vast sums of money in recent years in order to attract the best players available.

#  Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut Just Miles Away from Pittsfield MA!

When most people in Berkshire County think of casinos, they automatically think of the Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino complexes in Connecticut, just a short drive away.

The two casinos are operated by the same company, Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, and offer similar entertainment and gaming options. But there are important differences that can make one or the other more appealing for a particular visit.

The Foxwoods Resort Casino is the larger of the two, with 350,000 square feet of gambling space compared to Mohegan Sun's 240,000. That said, the Mohegan Sun has more tables (160 to Foxwoods' 144) and more slot machines (4,800 to 4,200).

Foxwoods also has a large variety of restaurants and bars - 36 in total - while Mohegan Sun offers only 25. However, at least eight of those at Foxwoods are familiar national chains like Red Lobster and Cheesecake Factory, while none of Mohegan Sun's restaurants are franchised.

Both casinos have world-class resorts attached, with luxury rooms and dozens of expensive shops. But again, Foxwoods has the edge with its two 18-hole golf courses while Mohegan Sun only has one.

So what's the verdict? If you want more table games and slots, go to Foxwoods. If you're looking for more restaurant options - especially more recognizable chains - then head to Mohegan Sun. And if you're looking for some good old fashioned gambling action together with some relaxation time on amazing golf courses, then it's a dead heat!

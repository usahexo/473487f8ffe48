#  Gambling Addict Loses 10K In Lawsuit

In a recent case, a gambling addict lost 10,000 pounds in a lawsuit after claiming that he had not been warned about the risks of gambling. The lawsuit was brought against the casino by the gambler, who argued that he had not been properly warned about the risks of gambling and that he should have been given information about addiction services.

The gambler, who was identified as John, stated in his testimony that he had visited the casino eight times prior to losing all of his money. He also said that he felt "pressured" into gambling and that he had not been given enough information about how to gamble responsibly.

The casino has defended itself against the allegations, stating that it provides customers with information about responsible gambling and that it is ultimately up to the individual to make responsible choices. It also argued that John was well aware of the risks of gambling and should not be allowed to take legal action against the casino simply because he lost money.

The case is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made. However, it serves as a reminder for gamblers everywhere to be aware of the risks associated with gambling and to gamble responsibly.

#  Gambling Addict Loses 10K, Claims Spirit of Mustang Abilify Lawsuit

In what could be the first of many lawsuits involving Abilify, a man in his early twenties who has been struggling with a gambling addiction since he was 14, has filed a lawsuit against Bristol-Myers Squibb, the manufacturer of the drug. The young man, who wishes to remain anonymous, lost $10,000 in a two-month period while taking Abilify and says that the drug caused him to gamble compulsively. He is seeking damages for the money he lost as well as for the significant emotional distress that the gambling caused him.

Abilify is an atypical antipsychotic drug that is approved by the FDA to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. Like many other antipsychotic drugs, Abilify can cause compulsive behaviors such as gambling, sexual promiscuity, and binge eating. In May of this year, the FDA issued a warning about these risks and advised patients and doctors to be vigilant about monitoring patients for signs of compulsive behavior.

The young man’s attorney, Ronald Sullivan Jr., said in a statement that his client “took Abilify as prescribed but quickly became addicted to the Gamble button on roulette websites. He would obsessive over when he’d next have money to gamble again. This led him into debt and periods of unemployment.” Sullivan Jr. also said that his client had never had any problems with gambling before he started taking Abilify and believes that the drug is responsible for his addiction.

Sullivan Jr. is not alone in this belief;many psychiatrists and other experts believe that antipsychotic drugs like Abilify can cause compulsive behaviors in some patients. In fact, there is even a movement among psychiatrists called “neurobilical psychiatry” which focuses on understanding how psychiatric drugs influence brain function and behavior.

Bristol-Myers Squibb has not yet commented on the lawsuit but it is likely that they will defend the safety of their drug. However, as more cases like this come to light, it is becoming increasingly difficult for pharmaceutical companies to deny that their drugs may have serious side effects for some patients

#  Gambling Addiction Leads to 10K Loss in Lawsuit

Lawyers for a man who claims he became addicted to gambling and lost more than $10,000 as a result have filed a lawsuit in hopes of recouping some of that money.

The plaintiff, identified only as J.D., became hooked on internet gambling in 2010 and has since lost over $10,600 according to the lawsuit. The defendant named in the suit is an unidentified online casino.

J.D.'s lawyers are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from the casino, arguing that they are responsible for their customer's losses.

"This type of addiction has become rampant," said attorney Brian Kabateck. "These casinos know exactly what they're doing when they lure people in with the promise of easy money."

Gambling addiction is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a real disorder, one that can lead to serious financial consequences for addicts and their families.

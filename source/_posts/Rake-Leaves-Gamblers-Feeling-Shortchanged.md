#  Rake Leaves Gamblers Feeling Shortchanged

The rake leaves gamblers feeling shortchanged, says a recent study conducted at the University of Waterloo. The research, which is set to be published in the journal "Problem Gambling," found that the amount of money taken by casinos in the form of rake and other fees is a major contributor to gambling addiction.

"Our findings suggest that reducing or eliminating casino fees could reduce rates of problem gambling," said study author Dr. Daniel King.

The research team looked at data on gambling addiction from around the world and found that, on average, about a third of problem gamblers' losses can be traced back to casino fees. In some jurisdictions, this figure rose as high as 50%.

Casino fees include not just rake - the percentage of each pot taken by the house - but also other charges such as those for parking or using slot machines.

King and his colleagues say that policymakers should consider regulating casino fees in order to protect vulnerable gamblers. "Casino operators are aware of their ability to influence problem gambling rates and have adjusted their policies and practices accordingly," said King. "It's time for governments to take note and respond."

#  Nevada Casino Rake Leaves Some Players Out in the Cold

The Nevada casino rake has been a hot topic lately. Some people are saying that it’s too high, and others are saying that it’s just right. No matter where you stand on the issue, one thing is for sure – the Nevada casino rake is leaving some players out in the cold.

To understand why this is happening, we first need to take a look at how the Nevada casino rake works. In short, the Nevada casino rake is a fee that is charged on each hand of poker that is played in a Nevada casino. This fee goes to the house, and it helps to offset the costs of running the casino.

The problem with the Nevada casino rake is that it’s too high. In fact, it’s one of the highest in the country. This means that players are paying more than they need to be, and it’s causing them to lose money.

There have been some efforts to lower the Nevada casino rake, but so far they have fallen on deaf ears. Casino executives seem happy with the way things are currently working, and they don’t seem interested in making any changes.

This is bad news for players because it means that they will continue to pay inflated prices for poker games. As a result, they will continue to lose money at an alarming rate.

So what can be done?

Unfortunately, not much can be done at this point. Players can voice their displeasure by boycotting casinos that have high rake rates, but there is no guarantee that this will result in any changes being made. In fact, there is a good chance that casinos will simply raise their rates even further in order to make up for lost revenue.

The best thing players can do at this point is sit back and hope that things change in the future. There is a good chance that they will, especially if more and more people start speaking out against high rake rates.

#  PokerStars penalizes players for violating rake rules

On July 11, 2017, PokerStars announced that it had issued penalties to a number of players for violating rake rules. The company said that the players had been raking in excess profits by playing at stakes that were too low for the amount of money they had deposited.

Under PokerStars' rake rules, players are not allowed to generate profits of more than $5 an hour at any given stakes level. If they do, they are subject to a penalty. The PokerStars enforcement team monitors the games and issues penalties to players who violate the rule.

In its statement, PokerStars said that it had issued penalties to a "small number" of players. It declined to provide specifics about the violations or the penalties that had been issued. However, it said that the players would be able to appeal the decisions.

The news of the fines comes as PokerStars is gearing up for its return to New Jersey's online gambling market. The company was forced out of the market in 2011 when New Jersey passed a law prohibiting payment processors from dealing with online gambling companies. But in February 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a new bill that overturned that law, paving the way for PokerStars' return.

The company is expected to launch its New Jersey site in September 2017. In preparation for its return, PokerStars has been ramping up its marketing efforts, including a new ad campaign that features actor Kevin James.

#  Delaware Gaming Commission investigating casino's high rake

The Delaware Gaming Commission is investigating the high rake at Delaware Park Casino. The commission is concerned that the high rake may be making it harder for players to win money.

The casino has been accused of taking too much of the money wagered by players. In some cases, the casino has taken more than 10 percent of the money wagered. This is much higher than the rake typically charged by other casinos.

The commission plans to investigate the allegations and determine whether the high rake is hurting players' chances of winning. It is also considering whether it should take any action to address the issue.

Delaware Park Casino has defended its high rake, saying that it is necessary to maintain its profitability. The casino said that it has already lowered its rake in some areas in response to complaints from players.

The commission will continue to investigate the matter and make a determination about what action, if any, needs to be taken.

#  Tribal casino accuses state of extorting high rake

The tribal casino in question has filed a lawsuit against the state, alleging that the state is extorting the casino by charging a high rake. The casino claims that this high rake is unfair and amounts to extortion.

The state has responded by stating that the casino agreed to the terms of the rake when it signed its gaming compact with the state. The state also argues that the high rake is necessary in order to cover the costs associated with regulating and overseeing the casino.

The casino is seeking an injunction to stop the state from charging the high rake. It is also seeking damages in excess of $100,000.

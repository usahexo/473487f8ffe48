#  Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson sells stake in Aliante casino

Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has sold his stake in the Aliante casino. The move comes as Las Vegas faces increased competition from new casinos in Singapore and Macau.

Adelson, who is also chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, owned a 32 percent stake in the Aliante. The sale generated $253 million for the billionaire.

The Aliante is one of the smaller casinos in Las Vegas. It has just over 2,000 slot machines and 71 table games. However, it is located close to the city's McCarran International Airport, which could make it attractive to buyers.

The sale comes as Las Vegas faces increased competition from new casinos in Singapore and Macau. In March, Adelson opened Europe's largest casino, the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel. The $2.4 billion complex has 4,000 hotel rooms, 1,200 gaming tables, and 3,000 slot machines.

Adelson's decision to sell his stake in the Aliante casino may be a sign that he plans to expand his operations in Asia.

#  MGM Resorts buys Aliante casino, vows to keep it free online slots

The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the all-clear to MGM Resorts International to purchase the Aliante casino in North Las Vegas.

The move was part of a larger restructuring for MGM, which also included the sale of itsMacau subsidiary to SJM Holdings Ltd. for $4.85 billion.

In a statement, MGM CEO Jim Murren said that the company is committed to keeping the Aliante casino free online slots operationally separate from its other properties.

"Aliante will remain a standalone casino and we will not be integrating it into our company-wide marketing or sales initiatives," he said. "It is important to us that we maintain the integrity of this property and its team."

Murren also praised the Aliante's workers, saying they have "been an important part of the local community and economy."

The Aliante casino first opened in 2008 and features 2,002 slots and 70 table games.

#  Caesars Entertainment buys Aliante casino, promises big renovations

Caesars Entertainment announced on Monday that it has agreed to purchase the Aliante casino in North Las Vegas. The deal is worth $270 million, and Caesars plans to invest another $90 million in renovations to bring the facility up to its standards.

The Aliante casino is a small facility by Las Vegas standards, with just over 2,000 slots and video poker machines. But it has been a popular destination for locals, and its relatively low-key atmosphere should fit in well with Caesars' strategy of catering to mid-level players.

"We are excited about this opportunity to purchase the Aliante casino and bring the Caesars brand to North Las Vegas," said Tony Rodio, President of Caesars Entertainment West. "This acquisition will allow us to better serve our guests in North Las Vegas with our world-class entertainment and gaming options."

The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.

#  Aliante casino sold to new mystery owner

The Aliante casino has been sold to a new, mystery owner. The new owner is unknown, and has not released any information about themselves or their plans for the casino.

This news comes as a surprise to many in the casino industry, as the Aliante has been performing well in recent years. It is not clear what the new ownership will do with the property, but speculation is that they may make some changes to the format or management of the casino.

The Aliante was opened in 2008, and is one of the smaller casinos in Las Vegas. It has been successful due to its focus on customer service and its relatively low prices. The new owner may change this focus or try to make the casino more luxurious, in an attempt to compete with larger properties such as The Cosmopolitan or Wynn Las Vegas.

Whatever changes are made, it is sure that they will be closely watched by other casinos in the city.

#  Aliante casino remains free online slots under new ownership

Aliante casino has been sold to a new ownership group, but the casino remains free online slots and open to the public. The new group, which is led by casino industry veteran Derek Stevens, has big plans for the property.

Stevens is a Michigan native who began his career in the casino industry as a blackjack dealer. He has since held executive positions at several casinos, including the MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity Casino, and Greektown Casino. In a statement announcing the purchase of Aliante casino, Stevens said that he is "looking forward to working with the team at Aliante to bring excitement and first-class service to guests."

The new ownership group has not announced any specific changes or improvements that they plan to make at Aliante casino, but they are likely to invest in new games and attractions to attract more visitors. The property has already undergone a major renovation in recent years, so it is likely that the new owners will focus on marketing and customer service rather than major construction projects.

Aliante casino is one of the smaller casinos in Las Vegas, but it has emerged as a favorite among locals due to its relatively low cost and its friendly atmosphere. The new ownership group is likely to maintain these aspects of the property while making some improvements that will appeal to tourists as well.

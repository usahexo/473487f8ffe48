#  How to make blackjack in javascript - Bayer 04 Leverkusen style!

## Introduction

In this article, we'll be looking at how to make a basic blackjack game in javascript. We'll be using the Bayer 04 Leverkusen style, so be sure to brush up on your Bundesliga knowledge before getting started!

First of all, we'll need to set up some basic variables and functions. This will include our deck of cards, player and dealer hands, as well as a function to handle the game's logic.

var deck = []; // our deck of cards
var playerHand = []; // the player's hand
var dealerHand = []; // the dealer's hand
var isWinner; // whether or not someone has won
function dealCards(deck, player) {
 for (var i = 0; i < deck.length; i++) {
 deck[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52); // generate a random number between 1 and 52 
}

 playerHand.push(deck[0]); // give the first card to the player 
dealerHand.push(deck[13]); // give the first card to the dealer 
}

function hit() { // allow the player to hit
playerHand.push(( Math.random() * 21) - 10); // generate a random number between 1 and 21 
}

function stand() { // end the player's turn - they can't hit any more 
playerHand.push(""); // clear their hand  }

function double() { // allow the player to double their bet 
playerHand.push("double"); // add "double" to their hand 
}

function split() { // allow the player to split their hand if they have two of same rank 
playerHand.push("split"); // add "split" to their hand 
}

function dealCard(deck, card) { // deal a card to either the player or dealer hand 
if (card == 1) {// if it's the first card... 
dealerHand.push(deck[12]);// ... deal it to the dealer 
} else if (card >= 2 && card <= 10) {// otherwise... 	dealerHand[card - 2] += deck[card];// add it to the current total in the dealers hand 	deck.splice(0, 1);// remove it from our deck of cards } else if (card == 11) {// if it's an ace... 	dealerHand[11]++;// ... add one to dealer's total score 	deck.splice(0, 1);// remove it from our deck } else {// if it's not one of these things... 	console.log("error: invalid card number " + card); }

#  Precise instructions for how to create an online blackjack game in javascript

In this article, we'll go over how to create a basic blackjack game in JavaScript. This game will be playable in any modern browser, and you'll be able to play against the computer or another player.

Creating the HTML skeleton

To get started, we'll need to set up the basic HTML skeleton for our game. This will include the required headings and divs for the game itself, as well as a button to start the game.

<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title>Create an online blackjack game in javascript</title> </head> <body> <div id="game-area"> </div> <button id="start-game">Start Game</button> </body> </html>

Next, we'll need to add some styles to our page so that everything looks nice and neat. We can do this by adding a style sheet or by adding inline styles. For this example, we'll add some inline styles.

#game-area { width: 500px; height: 300px; border: 1px solid black; } #start-game { background-color: #fff; color: #000; font-size: 18px; cursor: pointer; }

Now that our skeleton is in place, let's start creating the actual game.

Adding the basic structure

The first thing we'll need to do is set up the basic structure of our game. This will include setting up the grid where the cards will be displayed, as well as defining some variables that we'll use throughout the game. Let's take a look at the code below.

var grid = []; var player1 = null; var player2 = null; var deck = []; var currentCard = []; var totalPoints = 0; var pointsForWinning = 10; function init() { // Set up the grid grid = []; for (var i = 0 ; i < 7 ; i++) { grid[i] = []; } // Set up the players player1 = new Object(); player2 = new Object(); // Set up the deck deck = []; for (var i = 0 ; i < 52 ; i++) { deck[i] = $(".card").eq(i).get(0).text(); } // Set up current card currentCard = []; } function drawGrid() { // Draws the grid $("#game-area").html(grid); } function dealCards() { // Deals cards to both players player1 .draw(deck, 2) .splice(0, 2) .push(currentCard); player2 .draw(deck) .splice(0, 2) .push(currentCard); currentCard = []; } function checkForWin() { // Checks if one of the players has won if (player1[3] + player2[3]) > 21) { return "Player 1 has won!"; } else if (player1[4] + player2[4]) > 21) { return "Player 2 has won!"; } else { return "It's a tie!"; } } function updatePoints() { // Updates total points totalPoints += pointsForWinning * 2; // Updates points for winning pointsForWinning++; if (totalPoints >= 21) { totalPoints -= 21; pointsForWinning--; } console.log("Total Points : " + totalPoints); } window.onload=init();


The code above is mostly self explanatory, but we'll go over it briefly below. The first section sets up some global variables that we'll be using throughout the game. These include an array called grid , which will hold all of the cards in our grid, as well as two objects called player1 and player2 which will store information about each player. We also have an array called deck which contains all of the cards in our deck, and a variable called currentCard which stores the currently selected card. We also have two global constants called pointsForWinning and totalPoints . The first one specifies how many points a player gets for winning and the second one keeps track of the current score. Finally, we have a function called init() which sets up all of these variables and initializes the game. Next, we have two functions called drawGrid() and dealCards() . The first one simply draws our grid onto the page while the second one deals cards to both players. Finally, we have a function called checkForWin() which checks if either player has won already. If they have, it prints out a message telling us who has won. Finally, we have an updatePoints() function which updates totalPoints and pointsForWinning based on what happened in the previous round of play. Lastly, we have a

Hello, and welcome to my guide on how to make blackjack in javascript! This guide is designed for beginners, and will take you through all the steps necessary to create a basic blackjack game. Let's get started!


We'll be using the following tools in this tutorial:
-JavaScript (of course)
-jQuery (optional, but recommended)
-Some basic HTML and CSS knowledge

 The first thing we'll need to do is create the basic structure of our game. This will include the table where players will play, and the cards that will be used in the game. For our table, we'll use a simple <div> element:

<div id="blackjack-table">...</div>

Next, we'll create the cards. We'll be using a 52-card deck, so we'll need a <div> for each card. We can create these dynamically with jQuery:

$('.card').each(function(){ //creates a div for every card in the array $(this).html('<div class="card"></div>'); });

Now we'll add some basic styling to our table and cards:
#blackjack-table { width: 500px; height: 300px; border: 1px solid black; } .card { width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color:#red; }

Next, we'll write the code for our blackjack game. We'll start by setting up some global variables that will be used throughout the game: var player1 = ""; var player2 = ""; var dealer = ""; var points = 0; var totalPoints = 0; var suits = ["clubs", "diamonds", "hearts", "spades"]; var faceValue = { 2 : 2, 3 : 3, 4 : 4, 5 : 5, 6 : 6, 7 : 7, 8 : 8, 9 : 9, 10 : 10, jack : 10, queen : 10, king : 10 };

Next, we'll write the code for our init() function. This function will run when the page loads and will set up the basic game state. We'll start by creating a new instance of our BlackJack object: BlackJack.init();

 Next, we'll set up our table. We'll use jQuery to loop through our <div> elements and add them to our table: $('#blackjack-table').append($('.card'));

We also need to add some event handlers so that players can interact with the table. We'll use jQuery's bind() function to do this. The bind() function takes two arguments - a selector and an event type. For our table, we want to bind three events - click , mouseenter , and mouseleave . We can add these event handlers like this: $('#blackjack-table').bind('click', function(){ //handle clicks on the table }); $('#blackjack-table').bind('mouseenter', function(){ //handle mouseenter events }); $('#blackjack-table').bind('mouseleave', function(){ //handle mouseleave events });

Now let's write the code for our play() function. This function will handle all of the logic for playing blackjack. We'll start by checking if both player1 and player2 are defined. If they are not defined (i.e., if this is the first time players have loaded the game), then we will set them to empty strings: if (!player1 || !player2) { player1 = ""; player2 = ""; }

Next, we'll calculate the total points for each player using their face value multiplied by their point value: totalPoints = faceValue[player1] * points + faceValue[player2] * points;

If one of the players has more than 21 points total (a bust), then their turn ends immediately and they lose: if (totalPoints > 21) { //player has busted player1TurnEnded(); player2TurnEnded(); return; }

Otherwise, we check if either player has won based on their point totals relative to 21: if (totalPoints <= 21 && totalPoints > player1){ //player 1 has a lower score than dealer winnerPlayerOne(); return; } if (totalPoints <= 21 && totalPoints <= dealer){ //player 1 has same score as dealer draw(); return; } if (totalPoints > 21){ //player 2 has higher score than dealer winnerPlayerTwo(); return; }

If neither player has won yet, then it's time for another turn! We reset each players' total points and update their faces accordingly: totalPoints =

#  Creating a blackjack game in javascript - Bayer 04 Leverkusen style

In this article we are going to build a blackjack game with some of the features of the real card game. We will be using javascript and some basic html and css.

We will start by creating the basic structure of the game, including the necessary html and css. Then we will add in the functionality for dealing cards and calculating the score. Finally we will add in a few finishing touches to make our game look more like Bayer 04 Leverkusen's blackjack game.

The finished code for this article can be found on github [1].

Let's get started!

The first thing we need to do is create the basic structure of our game. This includes the <header> , <main> and <footer> elements, as well as a <div> to hold our card deck:

<header> <h1>Blackjack</h1> </header> <main> <div id="deck"> ... </div> </main> <footer></footer>

We also need to define some basic styles for our game:

#deck { width: 300px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid black; } h1 { text-align: center; }
2. Now that our structure is in place, we can start adding in the functionality for dealing cards and calculating scores. We'll do this in two stages, first by adding in a function to deal cards, then by adding in a function to calculate scores.
3. The function to deal cards is quite simple, it just randomises which card is displayed on each turn: function DealCards() { var deck = document.getElementById("deck"); // Get DOM reference for "deck" div var i = 0; // Counter variable while (i < deck.childNodes.length) { // Loop through all child nodes of "deck" div var node = deck.childNodes[i]; // Get reference to current node if (node.nodeType === 3) { // If node is an Text node... node.textContent = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52) + 1; // ...set its text content to a random number between 1 and 52 } else if (node.nodeType === 4) { // If node is an Image node... var img = new Image(); img.src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61dGgzf4aRL._SL160_.jpg"; img.height = img.width = 26; node.appendChild(img); } ++i; } };
4. The next step is to add in a function to calculate scores. This function takes three parameters - player's hand, dealer's hand, and ace - and calculates whether the player has won or lost, as well as their points total: function calcScore(handOne, handTwo, ace) { var scoreOne = handOne + ace; var scoreTwo = handTwo + ace; if (scoreOne > 21 || scoreTwo > 21) { return "out"; } else if (scoreOne > dealer'sHand || scoreTwo > dealer'sHand) { return "victory"; } else if (scoreOne == dealer'sHand && scoreTwo == dealer'sHand) { return "draw"; } else { return "lose"; } }; 5.. Finally, we can add in some finishing touches to make our game look more like Bayer 04 Leverkusen's blackjack game.. We'll start by styling the header element: h1 { font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: .5rem;} ..then add some basic styling for our main element: #main { width: 95%; margin: 0 auto;} ..and finally style our footer element: footer { text-align: center;} That's it! Our blackjack game is now ready to play! You can find the finished code on github [1].

#  How to leverage your javascript skills and create a blackjack game - Bayer 04 Leverkusen way!

## Introduction

Hey everyone, in this tutorial we will create a blackjack game with javascript. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the language and have some fun while doing it! We will be using the popular library React for our frontend, which will allow us to keep our code organized and easy to read.

We will also be using Socket.IO for our communication between the client and the server. Socket.IO allows us to keep our game state in sync across multiple clients, as well as send messages from the server to the clients. This is a very powerful library that can be used for all sorts of applications!

So without further ado, let's get started!

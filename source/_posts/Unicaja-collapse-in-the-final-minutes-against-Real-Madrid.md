#  Unicaja collapse in the final minutes against Real Madrid

Unicaja Malaga was upset by Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey semifinal on Wednesday, losing 85-81 after leading by six points with under four minutes to play.

It was a bitter end for Unicaja, which played its best game of the season but collapsed down the stretch. The home team dominated early, scoring the first 10 points, but Unicaja responded and led by five at halftime. It was all Unicaja in the third quarter, but Madrid made a late run to tie it up going into the fourth.

The visitors finally took control in the final minutes, with Luka Doncic hitting two big shots to put them up 83-79. Jaycee Carroll iced the game with a three-pointer from NBA range.

Doncic had 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists for Madrid, while Carroll added 19 points. Juancho Hernangomez led Unicaja with 22 points and nine rebounds. Alberto Abalde scored 16 off the bench.

#  Unicaja stuns Barcelona in a thrilling matchup

In a matchup that had been highly anticipated for weeks, Unicaja Malaga stunned La Liga powerhouse Barcelona with a 92-85 victory.

The home side got off to a hot start, opening up a double-digit lead in the first quarter. However, Barcelona mounted a furious comeback in the second half, taking the lead with just minutes remaining.

But Unicaja would not be denied, as they finished the game on a 10-2 run to take down the defending champions.

Rudy Fernandez led the way for Unicaja with 23 points, while Davis Bertans added 21 off the bench. For Barcelona, Antoine Griezmann led the way with 26 points.

#  Can Unicaja make history and win the Euroleague title?

The Euroleague is the top basketball competition in Europe and this season, there is a new contender for the title – Unicaja. The Spanish club has never won the competition, but they have a real chance of doing so this year.

Unicaja are currently in third place in the Euroleague, behind Real Madrid and Barcelona. However, they are just two games behind Madrid and one game behind Barcelona, so they still have a chance of winning the title. They will need to win their remaining games and hope that Madrid or Barcelona slip up, but it is definitely possible.

Unicaja have been in great form recently, winning six of their last seven games. Their only defeat during that run came against Real Madrid, so they will be hoping to avenge that loss in the final. They have a very strong team, with players like Jamel McClean, Alberto Abalde and Nemanja Nedovic.

The final of the Euroleague is taking place on May 18th and it should be an exciting match-up between two of Europe’s best teams. Unicaja certainly have a chance of causing an upset and winning their first ever Euroleague title.

#  Unicaja falls to CSKA Moscow in disappointing fashion

After a closely contested game, Unicaja Malaga fell to CSKA Moscow in the Euroleague Quarter Finals. The final score was 73-64, with CSKA advancing to the next round.

Malaga had the lead for most of the first half, but CSKA went on a run late in the second quarter to take a lead into halftime. Both teams played very tight defense in the second half, resulting in few scoring opportunities.

Malaga was led by Jamel McLean and Nando de Colo, who both scored 15 points. Alexey Shved paced CSKA with 20 points.

The loss ends an otherwise successful season for Unicaja. They had already clinched a spot in next year's Euroleague by winning their regular season group, and will likely be one of the favorites to win it all next year.

Preview: Unicaja takes on Maccabi Tel Aviv in search for first Euroleague win

The Spanish side, Unicaja, will hope to notch their first-ever Euroleague win when they take on Israeli powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv this week. Unicaja is coming off a close loss to Turkish side Anadolu Efes, while Maccabi Tel Aviv cruised to an easy victory over Limoges CSP.

Unicaja will be without veteran big man Alberto Abalde for the matchup against Maccabi Tel Aviv. The Spaniard is sidelined with an ankle injury and is expected to miss at least another week. This leaves coach Pablo Laso with just eight players available for Thursday's game.

Maccabi Tel Aviv has been one of the strongest teams in Euroleague this season, with a 7-1 record. Their only loss came against CSKA Moscow, who are currently the top team in the competition. Led by American guard Brian Roberts and Israelis Yonatan Cohen and Alex Tyus, Maccabi Tel Aviv has been averaging 86 points per game this season.

Unicaja will have its work cut out for it if it wants to get the victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv. However, with homecourt advantage and a raucous crowd behind them, anything is possible.

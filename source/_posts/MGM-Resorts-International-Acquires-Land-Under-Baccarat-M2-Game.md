#  MGM Resorts International Acquires Land Under Baccarat M2 Game

MGM Resorts seeks to expand its international presence with the acquisition of a plot of land in Macau for the development of a Baccarat table game.

The company announced Wednesday that is has closed on the purchase of 30,000 square feet of land at the Sands Cotai Central casino resort in Macau. MGM plans to build a new Baccarat table game salon on the site, which will complement the company’s existing suite of table games at Sands.

The acquisition is MGM’s latest foray into the burgeoning Macau market. The former Portuguese colony has seen gaming revenues surge in recent years as affluent Asian gamblers have flocked to the city’s casinos. In 2013, Macau’s gaming industry took in more than five times the amount generated by Las Vegas casinos.

MGM Resorts has been looking to capitalize on this growth, making a number of acquisitions and investments in Macau over the past few years. In addition to its new Baccarat salon, MGM operates two hotels and a casino in Macau.

The move comes as MGM faces increasing competition from rivals such as Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp., both of which have sizable operations in Macau.

#  Wynn Resorts buys Land Under Baccarat M2 Game

Las Vegas' Wynn Resorts has evidently moved to purchase some land in order to add a brand new building to its casino empire. The site is directly adjacent to the company's Baccarat table game area and grows the Wynn empire by some 1,033 feet.

The proposed structure is purportedly a 6 story edifice that will be used for additional game space, eateries and meeting rooms. It's also been mentioned that because of the fantastic views afforded by the site, there may even be some luxury condominiums included in the project. That would give another big boost to this resurgent market.

The land was purchased from Station Casinos LLC for a reported $6.7 million and represents a significant investment for Wynn Resorts. This comes as they are also expanding their offer of table games at other casino locations around Las Vegas.

Baccarat is currently the hottest table game around and with this expansion, Wynn is clearly looking to capitalize on that fact. It'll be interesting to see if any other casinos jump into this high stakes game and try to gain an edge on Wynn's growing market share.

#  Las Vegas Sands buys Land Under Baccarat M2 Game

The Las Vegas Sands Corporation announced that it had agreed to purchase the under-construction Land Under Baccarat (“LUB”), an upcoming casino resort in Macau. The deal, which is said to be worth up to $1.5 billion, will give LVS a dominant position in the Macau gaming market, as LUB will become the largest casino in the city when it opens.

Baccarat is one of the most popular games in Macau, and the new LUB resort is expected to be a major attraction for players. The resort will have 600 gambling tables, as well as luxury hotel rooms and other amenities.

The acquisition comes at a time when Macau’s gaming industry is experiencing some slowdown. However, analysts believe that LVS’s move is a smart long-term investment, as Macau is still expected to see strong growth in the coming years.

In a statement released by LVS, CEO Sheldon Adelson said: “We are excited about this opportunity to invest in what will be the largest baccarat casino in the world. This property offers tremendous potential and we look forward to working with our partners at SJM Holdings to bring it to life.”

The acquisition still requires regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of 2014.

#  Caesars Entertainment buys Land Under Baccarat M2 Game

Caesars Entertainment Corporation has agreed to purchase the land underneath a baccarat table game in Macau for $11 million. The game, known as “M2”, has been operational since July of this year and is currently one of the most popular games in the region.

The move is seen as a strategic one by Caesars, as they continue to expand their presence in the Asian gaming market. In a statement released by the company, Caesars notes that the purchase will give them an advantage over other competitors in the region.

“This acquisition provides us with an immediate footprint in one of the most important gaming markets in the world and cements our commitment to grow our business in Asia” said Caesars CEO Mark Frissora.

Land under casino games is a valuable commodity, and table games are generally considered to be more profitable than slot machines. This has led to a number of recent land acquisitions by casino operators in Macau and other Asian gaming markets.

For instance, earlier this year Wynn Resorts purchased a plot of land worth $522 million for use in its upcoming resort development in Macau. That followed purchases by MGM Resorts International and Sands China Ltd., both of which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on casino lands late last year.

#  The Genting Group buys Land Under Baccarat M2 Game

The Genting Group has announced the acquisition of a large plot of land with an underlying Baccarat M2 game from a subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corporation. The purchase price is undisclosed.

The Genting Group plans to build a world-class integrated resort on the site, which is expected to open in 2020. The new resort will feature 2,000 hotel rooms and suites, gaming floors, convention and meeting spaces, retail outlets and restaurants.

Baccarat M2 is the latest version of the popular casino game and is currently being rolled out in select locations around the world. The game offers players a more immersive experience, with enhanced graphics and sound effects.

The Genting Group already operates several luxury resorts around the world, including in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the United Kingdom.

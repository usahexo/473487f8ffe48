#  Casino Workers in Ireland on Strike Over Pay

On Monday, thousands of workers in the gambling industry in Ireland went on strike over pay. The workers, who are employed by companies that run casinos and slot machines, are seeking a pay rise of about €2 an hour.

The strike is expected to cause major disruption at casinos and slot machine venues across the country. Workers represented by SIPTU, one of Ireland's largest trade unions, say they have been seeking a pay increase for the past two years. "We've had enough," said Willie Figueroa, a worker at Citywest casino in Dublin. "The companies are making big profits, and we're getting peanuts."

The workers are also seeking improved working conditions, including more regular hours and better shift allowances. They accuse the companies of exploiting them by refusing to negotiate a fair pay deal. "These guys are only interested in maximising their profits," said Figueroa. "They don't care about us."

Labour Minister Regina Doherty has urged both sides to resume negotiations in order to avoid disruption at the country's casinos and slot machines. "Nobody wants this dispute to continue," she said. "I would urge both parties to get around the table as soon as possible and resolve this dispute."

#  Paddy Power Betfair Hit with Huge Tax Bill in Ireland

Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair has been hit with a huge tax bill in Ireland, according to reports.

The company is said to have been told by the Irish taxman that it needs to pay back taxes totaling €315 million (£269 million/$366 million).

Paddy Power Betfair is reported to be in the process of appealing the decision.

A spokesperson for the company said: "We can confirm that we have received an assessment from the Irish Tax Authority in respect of our Irish operations for the period 2010-2014.

"We believe this reflects an incorrect interpretation of the relevant tax law and we are confident of succeeding on appeal. We will update shareholders in due course."

If the bill is upheld, it would be a major blow for Paddy Power Betfair, which has seen its share price fall sharply in recent months.

The company was formed in 2016 when bookmaker Paddy Power and betting exchange Betfair merged their operations.

#  Slot Machine Makers Say Irish Tax Hike Threatens Jobs

The heads of the main companies involved in making slot machines have warned that an Irish government proposal to increase taxes on the gaming industry will lead to job losses and reduced investment.

In a letter to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, the CEOs of six firms – including Playtech, William Hill and Paddy Power Betfair - said the proposed “mechanical amusement device” tax will make their businesses uncompetitive.

The letter, seen by Reuters, says the tax increase – from 20 percent to 25 percent - would add €6 million ($7.1 million) to the firms’ costs and comes at a time when they are already investing in new products and technologies.

“Ireland is already struggling to attract investment in new technology-led industries...this tax hike will only serve to make Ireland less competitive,” it said.

A spokesman for Donohoe said he had not yet seen the letter but that any increase in taxation would be balanced with other measures to support the sector.

The government has been under pressure to find new sources of revenue as it seeks to reduce its budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP. In its latest budget proposals, announced last month, it increased taxes on a wide range of products and services, including cigarettes, alcohol and sugar.

#  A Brief History of Gambling in Ireland

Ireland has a long and colourful history with gambling. From early Celtic betting games to the modern day casino industry, Irish people have always enjoyed a flutter. This article will explore the development of gambling in Ireland, from its earliest origins to the present day.

The first recorded evidence of gambling in Ireland comes from the Celtic era. Back then, people would bet on animal fights and other sporting events. These early betting games were often used as a way to settle disputes or resolve conflicts.

In the 17th century, gambling began to spread throughout Ireland's aristocratic classes. Gambling dens became popular among the wealthy, and people would bet on card games, horse races, and various other contests. Irish society began to view gambling as a prestigious activity, and many people saw it as a way to show off their wealth and status.

During the 19th century, gambling continued to grow in popularity throughout Ireland. Slot machines were introduced to Irish casinos in the 1890s, and this marked the beginning of Ireland's love affair with casino gaming. By the 1920s, there were dozens of casinos operating throughout Ireland.

Since then, casino gaming has become increasingly popular in Ireland. In recent years, there has been a major resurgence in interest in online casinos, with Irish players now making up a significant percentage of global online gaming revenues.

So why do Irish people love gambling so much? There are probably many different reasons, but one of the key factors is undoubtedly our love of sport. Gambling on sporting events is ingrained in Irish culture, and we have always been willing to place a bet on just about anything. Whether it's horseracing, Gaelic football or rugby matches, Irish people love to put their money on the line and see how things play out.

Another reason for our passion for gambling may be our fondness for risk-taking! We are a nation of adventurers at heart, and we enjoy taking chances and testing our luck against the odds. Gambling is the ultimate risk-taking activity, and it's no surprise that so many Irish people are drawn to it.

Whatever the reasons may be, it's clear that gambling is deeply woven into Irish culture. We have been enjoying a flutter for centuries now, and there's no sign of that changing anytime soon!

#  How Do Slot Machines Work in Ireland?

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. But how do they work, and how can you make money playing them? Here’s everything you need to know!

Slot machines are typically easy to play. You just insert your money into the machine, choose your bet size, and hit the spin button. The reels will then start spinning, and if you match any of the symbols on the reels, you’ll win a prize. The amount you win will depend on the winning combination, and the size of your bet.

Most slot machines offer a range of different betting options, so you can choose a bet that suits your budget. And some slot machines also offer progressive jackpots – which can be worth millions of pounds!

So how do these slots work? Basically, each reel contains a number of different symbols. When you hit the spin button, these symbols will rotate around the reels. If they stop in the correct position, then you’ll win a prize.

The chances of winning vary depending on the symbol – for example, diamonds are typically harder to land than cherries. And some symbols – such as bonus symbols – can unlock bonus rounds or other special features.

So now that you know how slot machines work, why not give them a try? You might just be able to walk away with a big win!

Study finds genetic, environmental factors may play role"></a>Why do people become gambling addicts? Study finds genetic, environmental factors may play role</h1><p>A study published in the “Journal of Gambling Studies” has found that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in why some people become gambling addicts.</p>
<p>The study, which looked at over 1,000 people who were addicted to gambling, found that genes related to impulsiveness and sensation seeking were more likely to be found in those with gambling addictions. Environmental factors, such as being raised in a home where there was excessive gambling, also increased the risk of addiction.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Luke Clark, said that the findings could help to improve treatments for gambling addiction.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that genes and environment work together to increase the risk of developing a gambling addiction,” said Clark. “This information may help us to develop better treatments for gambling addiction in the future.”</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a relatively new field of research and much is still unknown about what causes it. This study provides some valuable insight into the role that genes and environment may play in its development.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Many-can’t-resist-the-thrill-of-risk"><a href="#Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Many-can’t-resist-the-thrill-of-risk" class="headerlink" title="Why do people become gambling addicts? Many can’t resist the thrill of risk"></a>Why do people become gambling addicts? Many can’t resist the thrill of risk</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can be very difficult to overcome. Some people become addicted to gambling because they enjoy the thrill of risk. They find it exciting to risk money on games or activities where the outcome is uncertain. Gambling can also provide an escape from boredom or problems in their lives.</p>
<p>For some people, gambling becomes a way to cope with stress or emotional problems. They may use gambling as a way to relieve boredom or loneliness. They may also use gambling as a way to forget about their problems and escape from reality.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can be very damaging both physically and emotionally. It can ruin relationships, cost money, and lead to other risky behaviors. If you or someone you know has a problem with gambling, seek help as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Some-may-have-addictive-personalities"><a href="#Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Some-may-have-addictive-personalities" class="headerlink" title="Why do people become gambling addicts? Some may have addictive personalities"></a>Why do people become gambling addicts? Some may have addictive personalities</h1><p>There are many reasons why people develop gambling addictions. Some may have addictive personalities and be more likely to become addicted to anything that provides a rush or excitement, such as drugs, alcohol or gambling.</p>
<p>Others may start gambling as a way to escape from their problems or to relieve boredom or stress. Gambling can become an addiction when someone starts to need the thrill of winning more and more money to feel good. They may also start to lie about how much they are gambling and how much money they are losing in order to cover up their addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addicts can lose a lot of money and experience problems with relationships, work and studies as a result of their addiction. It is important for addicts and their families to get help for gambling addiction before it causes too much damage.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Impulsiveness-may-be-key-factor"><a href="#Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Impulsiveness-may-be-key-factor" class="headerlink" title="Why do people become gambling addicts? Impulsiveness may be key factor"></a>Why do people become gambling addicts? Impulsiveness may be key factor</h1><p>Gambling is a problem that is increasing in prevalence all over the world. Gambling addiction is a serious disorder that can have disastrous consequences for both the addict and their loved ones. Why do some people become addicted to gambling, while others do not? Scientists believe that impulsiveness may be a key factor in addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>Addiction to gambling is characterised by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, despite the negative consequences it may have on the individual’s life. Addicts will often gamble away large sums of money, leading to financial ruin, and they may also lose important relationships due to their gambling habit. Why do some people become addicted to gambling while others do not?</p>
<p>One possible explanation is that people who are more impulsive are more likely to develop an addiction to gambling.People who are impulsive tend to act without thinking about the consequences of their actions, and they are more likely to take risks. This may lead them to gamble more heavily than someone who is less impulsive, and eventually leads to addiction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is some evidence that genetics may also play a role in addiction to gambling. Some studies have shown that there is a genetic component to impulsiveness,and this may predispose certain individuals to develop an addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>So what can be done if you or someone you know has a problem with gambling? If you think you may be addicted to gambling, it is important to seek help from a professional therapist or counsellor. There are also many self-help groups available for people with a gambling addiction, and these can be very helpful in getting your life back on track.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Some-may-turn-to-gambling-to-cope-with-stress"><a href="#Why-do-people-become-gambling-addicts-Some-may-turn-to-gambling-to-cope-with-stress" class="headerlink" title="Why do people become gambling addicts? Some may turn to gambling to cope with stress"></a>Why do people become gambling addicts? Some may turn to gambling to cope with stress</h1><p>Wagering can provide an adrenaline rush and a sense of pleasure that comes with winning, which is similar to the feelings people get from activities such as eating, drinking and sex. This can be addictive to some people. Gambling can also become a way to avoid problems or uncomfortable feelings. For instance, someone who is feeling anxious or down may gamble in an attempt to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. Some people may not even realize they have a problem until it has caused significant damage in their life. If you are worried about your gambling or someone you know may have a problem with gambling, there are signs to look out for:</p>
<p>■ Spending more time and money gambling than intended<br>■ Becoming restless or irritable when unable to gamble<br>■ Lying about gambling or hiding losses<br>■ Feeling guilty or ashamed about gambling<br>■ Neglecting work, school or personal obligations due to gambling<br>■ Trying unsuccessfully to cut back on gambling</p>

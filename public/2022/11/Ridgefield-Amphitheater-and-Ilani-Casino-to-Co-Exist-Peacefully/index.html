<h1 id="Ridgefield-Amphitheater-Far-Enough-Away-from-Ilani-Casino"><a href="#Ridgefield-Amphitheater-Far-Enough-Away-from-Ilani-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Ridgefield Amphitheater Far Enough Away from Ilani Casino"></a>Ridgefield Amphitheater Far Enough Away from Ilani Casino</h1><p> Ridgefield is a city in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 4,594 at the 2010 census. Ridgefield is the home of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater is a new and upcoming concert venue that is far enough away from Ilani Casino Resort so as not to conflict with attendance. It is located in Ridgefield, WA on the edge of the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>The amphitheater has a grassy hill that seats about 3,000 people and an additional covered seating area for about 1,500 people. The amphitheater will also have an outdoor stage that can accommodate large productions and a lawn for general admission seating. There is also parking for more than 1,000 cars and a bike path connecting to the refuge.</p>
<p>The entire site covers about 17 acres and was funded by a $1.5 million dollar bond measure passed by the City of Ridgefield in November of 2016. The venue is expected to open in May of 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Ridgefield-Amphitheater-to-Get-1-Million-Renovation"><a href="#Ridgefield-Amphitheater-to-Get-1-Million-Renovation" class="headerlink" title="Ridgefield Amphitheater to Get $1 Million Renovation"></a>Ridgefield Amphitheater to Get $1 Million Renovation</h1><p>In Ridgefield, Connecticut, the amphitheater is getting a much-needed renovation.</p>
<p>The town has committed to spending $1 million on the project, which is set to begin in 2019. The renovation will include new seating, restrooms, and a concession stand.</p>
<p>The amphitheater first opened in 1984 and has been used for a variety of events over the years, including plays, concerts, and festivals. It can accommodate up to 3,000 people.</p>
<p>Local officials are hoping that the renovation will help spur more economic development in the area. They believe that it will make the amphitheater a more attractive destination for events and help to attract new businesses to the town.</p>
<p>Some residents have raised concerns about the cost of the project, but officials say that they are confident that it will be worth it in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="Ridgefield-Marks-Milestone-in-Construction-of-Amphitheater"><a href="#Ridgefield-Marks-Milestone-in-Construction-of-Amphitheater" class="headerlink" title="Ridgefield Marks Milestone in Construction of Amphitheater"></a>Ridgefield Marks Milestone in Construction of Amphitheater</h1><p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater is progressing rapidly as the town celebrates a milestone in its construction. The amphitheater is set to be completed this summer, and will provide Ridgefield residents and visitors with a venue for music, theater, and other outdoor events.</p>
<p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater has been in the works for several years, with the town taking on the project to provide an outdoor space for the community. The amphitheater will be located in Stanley Park, near the downtown area of Ridgefield.</p>
<p>The $6 million project is being funded through a combination of public and private funds. The town contributed $2 million, while another $1 million was raised through private donations. The remaining funds were provided by state and federal grants.</p>
<p>Construction on the amphitheater began last summer, with crews working to clear and prepare the site. The foundation was then put in place, followed by the installation of the stage and seating. Work is now underway on the roof and other finishing touches.</p>
<p>The amphitheater will have a capacity of 1,500 people, making it one of the largest venues in the area. It will also feature a concessions stand and restrooms. There will be room for parking as well, with a total of 150 spots available.</p>
<p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater is expected to be completed by early summer, just in time for the start of the concert season. A number of concerts and other events have already been scheduled for the new venue, including performances by The Doobie Brothers, Kansas, and comedian Sinbad.</p>
<h1 id="Work-Begins-on-Ridgefield-Amphitheater"><a href="#Work-Begins-on-Ridgefield-Amphitheater" class="headerlink" title="Work Begins on Ridgefield Amphitheater"></a>Work Begins on Ridgefield Amphitheater</h1><p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater is a new project that is currently underway in Ridgefield, WA. The amphitheater is being built on a former golf course, and will be able to seat up to 6,000 people. It will also have an open green space that can be used for concerts, public gatherings, and more.</p>
<p>The project has been in the works for many years, and it’s finally starting to come together. The city of Ridgefield has announced that they have selected a contractor to begin work on the amphitheater. The project is expected to take about two years to complete, and it will be a great addition to the community.</p>
<p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater will be used for a variety of events, including concerts, festivals, and more. It will also be available for private events, such as weddings and corporate gatherings. This will be a great venue for the community and for visitors alike.</p>
<p>The Ridgefield Amphitheater is sure to be a popular destination for events in the area. It will provide a great place for people to gather and enjoy music and other forms of entertainment. We look forward to seeing this project come together and watching the amphitheater become a staple of the Ridgefield community.</p>
